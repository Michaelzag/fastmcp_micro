# Designing a Modular, Agentic Workflow with FastMCP

## Overview

FastMCP enables you to build a system as a network of composable, isolated, and interoperable microservices—each exposing its own tools, resources, and prompts via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is ideal for agentic workflows, where you want to combine automation, LLMs, and human-in-the-loop processes, all while maintaining clear boundaries and extensibility.

## System Components and Responsibilities

Let’s break down the workflow into logical components, each as its own FastMCP server:

### 1. Gmail Retrieval Service
- **Responsibility:** Connects to Gmail, fetches new emails, and exposes them as resources or via a tool.
- **Isolation:** Handles only Gmail API logic and authentication.
- **MCP Role:** Exposes a tool like `fetch_emails` and a resource like `email://{id}`.

### 2. Classification & Caching Service
- **Responsibility:** Classifies emails (using rules, ML, or LLMs) and stores them in a local cache/database for fast access.
- **Isolation:** Decouples slow external API (Gmail) from fast local operations.
- **MCP Role:** Exposes tools for `classify_email`, `add_to_cache`, and resources for cached emails.

### 3. Email Monitoring Orchestrator
- **Responsibility:** Periodically triggers the Gmail retrieval and classification pipeline.
- **Isolation:** Focuses only on workflow orchestration and scheduling.
- **MCP Role:** Orchestrates calls to the above services, possibly exposing a `run_pipeline` tool.

### 4. Graph Database Ingestion Service
- **Responsibility:** Processes classified emails and adds them to a graph database, mapping relationships based on content.
- **Isolation:** Handles only graph logic and ingestion.
- **MCP Role:** Exposes tools/resources for `add_to_graph`, `query_graph`, etc.

### 5. Content Enrichment Service
- **Responsibility:** As emails are added to the graph, this service enriches nodes by searching for additional information (web, APIs, etc.).
- **Isolation:** Designed to be extensible—new data sources can be plugged in via MCP tools.
- **MCP Role:** Exposes a flexible `enrich_content` tool and a plugin interface for new data sources.

### 6. Task Queue & Notification Service
- **Responsibility:** Maintains a queue of user tasks, triggers notifications based on rules, and exposes task management endpoints.
- **Isolation:** Handles only stateful task tracking and event rules.
- **MCP Role:** Exposes tools/resources for `add_task`, `get_pending_tasks`, `notify_user`, etc.

### 7. LLM Agent Service
- **Responsibility:** Handles tasks that require LLM reasoning, summarization, or generation.
- **Isolation:** Keeps LLM logic separate, can be swapped for different models/providers.
- **MCP Role:** Exposes tools for `run_agent_task`, `summarize_email`, etc.

## How FastMCP Enhances This Workflow

### A. Isolation and Composability
- Each component is a FastMCP server, running in its own process/environment.
- Components communicate via MCP, not direct imports or function calls.
- You can develop, deploy, and scale each service independently.

### B. Orchestration via Mounting and Proxying
- The orchestrator (or a higher-level “super-agent”) can mount other MCP servers, routing requests to the right sub-system.
- Proxying allows bridging between environments (e.g., local, remote, containerized).

### C. Extensibility
- New data sources for enrichment can be added as new MCP tools or even as new servers, mounted or proxied into the enrichment service.
- The system can grow horizontally by adding new skills/services with zero changes to the core orchestrator.

### D. Secure, Controlled Data Access
- Roots access allows you to tightly control which files or data stores each service can access.
- Sensitive operations (e.g., LLM completions) can be isolated to dedicated, secure components.

### E. Human-in-the-Loop and Agentic Actions
- The task queue can expose tasks to users or LLMs via MCP tools/resources.
- LLM agent service can be called as needed, with clear boundaries and logging.

### F. Observability and Maintainability
- Each service can be monitored, logged, and debugged independently.
- Failures in one component do not cascade to others.

## Example High-Level Architecture

```
+-----------------------------+      +---------------------+
|     Email Monitor/Orch      |----->| Gmail Retrieval     |
|  (mounts: retrieval, cache) |      +---------------------+
|                             |----->| Classification/Cache|
|                             |      +---------------------+
|                             |----->| Task Queue/Notify   |
|                             |      +---------------------+

|                             |      +---------------------+
|                             |----->| Content Enrichment  |
|                             |      +---------------------+
|                             |----->| LLM Agent           |
|                             |      +---------------------+
+-----------------------------+

## Workflow Example

1. **Monitor triggers pipeline:** Calls Gmail service to fetch emails.
2. **Classify & cache:** For each new email, calls classification service, then stores in cache.
3. **Ingest to graph:** For each classified email, calls graph ingestion service.
4. **Enrich content:** As graph nodes are added, enrichment service is called, using plugins for new data sources.
5. **Task queue:** If a rule is triggered (e.g., “urgent” email), adds a task to the queue and notifies the user.
6. **LLM agent:** For tasks requiring reasoning, orchestrator calls the LLM agent service.

## Extending and Maintaining the System

- **Add a new data source?** Write a new MCP server or tool, mount it in enrichment.
- **Swap out LLM provider?** Replace the LLM agent service, everything else stays the same.
- **Scale email classification?** Run multiple instances of that service.
- **Debugging?** Isolate issues to a single service.

## Conclusion

**FastMCP acts as the “glue” and boundary layer for your agentic workflow, enabling:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy extensibility and maintainability
- Secure, observable, and agent-ready architecture
- Future-proofing for new AI and automation capabilities

**You don’t need to pick packages or technologies up front—just define your interfaces and boundaries using FastMCP, and the rest of your stack can evolve as needed.**
