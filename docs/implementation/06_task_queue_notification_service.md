# Task Queue & Notification Service (FastMCP)

_Proposed development order: 6_

# Overview

The Task Queue & Notification Service is a critical component of the FastMCP system, responsible for managing and processing tasks and notifications. This service will provide a scalable and reliable way to handle tasks and notifications, ensuring that the system remains responsive and efficient.

## Architecture

The Task Queue & Notification Service will be built using a microservices architecture, with the following components:

*   **Task Queue**: responsible for managing and processing tasks
*   **Notification Service**: responsible for sending notifications to users
*   **API Gateway**: responsible for handling incoming requests and routing them to the appropriate service

## Task Queue

The Task Queue will be implemented using a message broker, such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka. This will allow for efficient and scalable processing of tasks, as well as provide features such as message queuing, routing, and retries.

## Notification Service

The Notification Service will be responsible for sending notifications to users via various channels, such as email, SMS, or push notifications. This service will be built using a notification library, such as NodeMailer or Twilio.

## API Gateway

The API Gateway will be responsible for handling incoming requests and routing them to the appropriate service. This will be implemented using a reverse proxy server, such as NGINX or Apache HTTP Server.

## Technical Requirements

* Python 3.13+
* `redis`, `notifiers`
* `fastmcp`, `pydantic`, `logfire`
* All dependencies managed by `uv` and listed in `pyproject.toml`

## Development Roadmap

The development of the Task Queue & Notification Service will be broken down into the following stages:

*   **Stage 1**: Design and implement the Task Queue using a message broker
*   **Stage 2**: Design and implement the Notification Service using a notification library
*   **Stage 3**: Design and implement the API Gateway using a reverse proxy server
*   **Stage 4**: Integrate the Task Queue, Notification Service, and API Gateway
*   **Stage 5**: Test and deploy the Task Queue & Notification Service

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialize the project using `uv init task-queue-notification-service` (Python 3.13+).
- Add dependencies: `uv add fastmcp pydantic redis notifiers logfire`.
- Use `main.py` as entry point, create `schemas.py` for Pydantic models, and `queue_client.py` for Redis/notification logic.
- Store config and secrets in `.env` or environment variables.

### 2. Schema and Contract Definition
- Define `Task`, `Notification`, and related schemas in `schemas.py` using Pydantic.
- Document expected input/output in the README and OpenAPI doc.

### 3. Queue & Notification Integration
- Use `redis` for task queue management.
- Use `notifiers` for sending notifications (email, SMS, etc.).
- Implement task lifecycle: create, update, complete, fail.
- Handle retries, dead-letter queue, and notification failures.

### 4. MCP Interface Implementation
- Register `create_task`, `complete_task`, `trigger_notification`, and `get_task` as FastMCP tools/resources.
- Expose all as REST endpoints via FastAPI.

### 5. Configuration & Environment
- Use `dotenv` or FastMCP config loader to read `.env`.
- Document required environment variables: `REDIS_URL`, notification configs, etc.
- Provide a sample `.env.example` file.

### 6. Testing
- Unit tests for queue and notification logic (mock Redis/notification backends).
- Integration tests for FastMCP endpoints.
- Contract tests for schema compliance.
- Edge case tests: queue full, notification errors, invalid input.
- Use `pytest` and `pytest-cov` for coverage.

### 7. Observability & Logging
- Log all task and notification events, errors with `logfire`.
- Add metrics for queue latency, notification success/failure rate.
- Provide log configuration in `pyproject.toml` or `.env`.

### 8. Deployment
- Containerize with a `Dockerfile`.
- Expose port (default 8000) for FastAPI server.
- Document healthcheck endpoint (e.g., `/healthz`).
- Provide example `docker-compose.yml` for local dev (with Redis).

### 9. Security & Compliance
- Never log sensitive data or secrets.
- Validate all inputs with Pydantic.
- Store secrets in env, not in code or logs.
- Document data retention policy for tasks and notifications.

### 10. Maintenance & Future Work
- Document how to add new notification channels.
- Instructions for queue scaling and failover.
- Plan for supporting distributed task processing.
- Add monitoring hooks for production deployment.

### Example `.env.example`
```
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
EMAIL_API_KEY=...
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Example API Calls

#### Create Task
`POST /tools/create_task`
```json
{
  "description": "Process new email",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

#### Complete Task
`POST /tools/complete_task`
```json
{
  "task_id": "abc123"
}
```

#### Trigger Notification
`POST /tools/trigger_notification`
```json
{
  "task_id": "abc123",
  "channel": "email"
}
```

#### Get Task
`GET /resources/get_task/{task_id}`

### Troubleshooting Checklist
- [ ] Are all required env vars set? (`REDIS_URL`, `EMAIL_API_KEY`)
- [ ] Is Redis reachable and running?
- [ ] Are FastMCP endpoints up and documented in OpenAPI?
- [ ] Are logs and metrics being generated?
- [ ] Do all contract tests pass?

## Conclusion

The Task Queue & Notification Service is a critical component of the FastMCP system, providing a scalable and reliable way to handle tasks and notifications. By following the development roadmap outlined above, we can ensure that this service is delivered on time and meets the requirements of the system.
